# Hello World!

You're probably here because you're a CHIRP volunteer who's interested in getting involved with the tech team. If that's the case, then congratulations, you've come to the right place! You'll probably want to begin with the [Quick-Start guide](quickstart.md), and then look over our [Active Projects](active_projects.markdown) section.

"But omnipotent wiki," you might be saying, "I have no idea what the tech team even does, and I'm not sure whether I want to be involved!" Be still, my child, the [Quick-Start guide](quickstart.md) truly may contain the answers you're looking for. Just check it out! It's right there.

"No, really, wiki" you say, "I have no idea what CHIRP even is! In fact, I have no idea how I even got here. I'm so confused!" If that's the case, I still have the answers you seek. CHIRP Radio is the Chicago Independent Radio Project. You can find out more about CHIRP, as well as how to become a volunteer, at [chirpradio.org](http://chirpradio.org). Hear what's next!
