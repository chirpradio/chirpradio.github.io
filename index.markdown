# Hello World!
## Welcome to the CHIRP Radio Tech Wiki

You're probably here because you're a CHIRP volunteer who's interested in getting involved with the tech team. If that's the case, then congratulations, you've come to the right place! You'll probably want to begin in the sidebar with the Quick-Start guide, and then look over our Active Projects section.

_"But omnipotent wiki,"_ you might be saying, _"I have no idea what CHIRP even is! In fact, I have no idea how I even got here. I'm so confused!"_

If that's the case, fear not! I still have the answers you seek. CHIRP Radio is the Chicago Independent Radio Project. You can find out more about CHIRP, as well as how to become a volunteer, at [chirpradio.org](http://chirpradio.org). Hear what's next!
