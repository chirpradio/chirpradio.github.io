## What is the Album Review Tracker?
The Album Review Tracker is currently only a prototype, but our hope is that it will eventually replace the Music Department's very manual process of tracking album reviews via spreadsheets and emails.

Current Functionality Includes:
* Secure login and user roles for Volunteer, Admin, and Music Department users
* Create, edit, display, and sort data for all albums that need a review
* Claim and submit a review for an album (including email alerts and delivery of music files)
* View and edit reviews you've claimed
* Export completed reviews and album metadata for upload to music database

## Tech Specs
The Album Review Tracker is a no-code app created using a drag-and-drop app creator called Glide. Documentation on Glide is [here](https://www.glideapps.com/docs).
